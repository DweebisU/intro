                <h4>I'm a DJ,</h4>
                <p>When it comes to being a fan of EDM (eletronic dance music), I'd like to think I'm right at #1. So what better way to express that than to DJ? My future plans include integrating DMX controls, more equipment and even having access to online music libraries to preform any song, anytime. But that's only the half of it.</p>

                <h4>as well as a driver.</h4>
                <p>I could talk your ear off about my car. Or I could summarize it here.<br>My grandfather raced Formula Ford at Road America, and racing has been in the family since. I am a big fan of euro cars, however my dream is to one day own an Abarth.</p>
